# ws-projects
Collection of web-semantic side projects exploring tools, technologies and skills needed to support/develop Linked (Open) Data based applications. Milestones includes the following road map in three key sections.

CONVERT - Convert relational database and other popular datasources to [RDF Graph](http://www.linkeddatatools.com/introducing-rdf "Introducing Graph Data") containing [RDF Triples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_triple "Semantic triple").

PREPARE - Prepare the data (Triples) in the RDF Graph into retrievable resources that can be used on demand easily by machines (AI) or by Users for data processing or presentation usage.

PRESENT - Present Linked (Open) Data in a meaningful way for end users to understand the data easily and discover value through new insight and opportunities that is not possible through traditional means.
