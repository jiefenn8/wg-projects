# ws-projects
Collection of web-semantic side projects exploring tools, technologies and skills needed to support/develop Linked Data based applications. Goals includes the following plans in three sections.

CONVERT - Convert relational database and other popular datasources to [semantics graph](http://www.linkeddatatools.com/introducing-rdf) containing statements.

PREPARE - Prepare the data (statements) in the semantics graph into retrievable resources that can be used on demand easily by machines (AI) or by users for data processing or presentation usage.

PRESENT - Present Linked Data in a meaningful way for end users to understand the data easily and discover value through new insight and opportunities that is not possible through current technology.

## Notes
The side project started a while ago for a short period during early 2018 which resulted in a small working prototype from back-end to front end. This is quick redo with a much clearer direction and requirement with git.
