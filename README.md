Collection of web and graph related side projects exploring tools, technologies and skills needed to make web and graph related applications. Goals includes the following plans in three parts.

CONVERT - Convert data in relational database and other popular datasource types to graph data.

PREPARE - Prepare the data in the graph into retrievable resources that can be used on demand easily by machines or by users for data processing or presentation usage.

PRESENT - Present Linked Data in a meaningful way for end users to understand the data easily and discover value through new insight and opportunities that is not possible through current technology.
